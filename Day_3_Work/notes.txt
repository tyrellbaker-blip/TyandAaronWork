Lists are accessed by their index and they index from zero.

So for a list:
Aarons_favorite_games = ["bonk.io", "Cities Skylines", "Foxhole",
                             "Rimworld", "Xcom 2"]

                                 my_number = random.randint(1, 10)
    print(my_number)
rank1 = Aarons_favorite_games[0]
rank2 = Aarons_favorite_games[1]
rank3 = Aarons_favorite_games[2]
rank4 =Aarons_favorite_games[3]
rank5 = Aarons_favorite_games[4]
